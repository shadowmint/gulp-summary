# gulp-nodeunint

Runs the console node unit runner on test files.

## Why?

...because the other node unit runners dont work with watch.

This task will not trigger random errors during the pipeline
and execution of tests when combined correctly with gulp-plumber.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save-dev shadowmint/gulp-nodeunit#0.0.2
```

## Usage

See the demo/ folder for a usage example using gulp-plumber and gulp-babel.
